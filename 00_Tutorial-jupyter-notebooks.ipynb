    "Python is a programming language commonly used in Data Science. The Codedfinity website lists \"10 reasons to Learn Python\", here I share just a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ease of Learning, pretty straight forward and the code makes sense\n",
    "* Versatility, it can be used for quite a few different things\n",
    "* Community and Support, lots of people are working with Python and lots of forums to get help\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be run interactively or with scripts. The software to run Python is typically contained within a development environment. These development environments must be installed on the computer for you to run the Python code you create. Fortunately, the development environment is typically open-source, free software that can run on various computer operating systems.\n",

    "## 1.2 Why use a Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter-notebooks provide a way to integrate code and documentation together within a web-based development environment. These tutorials aare an example of how the text documentation combined with the code provides a convenient teaching platform where the code can be run right alongside the explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Data Science, the notebook format allows you to explore the data you are trying to analyze with output graphs and tables right next to the code. The notebook can then be easily shared with other researchers who can run the same code, make small changes, or explore different options in the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "While you could run a Jupyter notebook on your computer if you have Python installed, you could also connect via a web-browser to a Jupyter server somewhere else on the internet. This allows people to easily interact with code from any computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are one way that users of the Rubin Science Platform can access and analyze data from the LSST. Because the code is running on the Jupyter server at the RSP, the vast data sets can be accessed without having to download the data to your local computer"
